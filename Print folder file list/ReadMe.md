**Print folder file List**

Using a function it is possible to print a list of all the files in a specified folder. 
You enter the full folder path including the folder's name as an input paramater and the full
list is output to the debug window. You can modify the code to output to anywhere you like
including directly into your Excel worksheet. 
Alternatively, if using Excel, you can use Power Query to obtain a list of files.
