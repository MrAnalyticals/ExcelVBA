Use one PowerShell script to create a fully functioning Excel VBA Database!!

PowerShell is a scripting language and automation framework developed by Microsoft.
•	It’s a task automation and configuration management language.
•	Based on the .NET framework (and now .NET Core/5+ for cross-platform PowerShell).
•	Syntax is somewhat similar to other shells (like Bash), but it’s object-oriented, meaning commands return full .NET objects instead of plain text.
•	Files usually use the .ps1 extension.
•	It combines:
o	Command-line shell features (running commands interactively)
o	Scripting language features (writing reusable scripts/functions)
o	Access to .NET APIs (very powerful for Windows automation).
So in short: PowerShell is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language built on .NET, mainly used for system administration and automation.

Audio Script is here: 
I have created a powershell script that creates an xlsm file and injects vba code into it. Here we can see the table, form, macro buttons and vba generated by the powershell script. Let’s run the script and see it in action. 
I enter the name of the script file in the powershell command line. 
The response confirms the script completed and the xlsm file was generated. 
Let’s have a look at the Excel file. On the form sheet we can see the labels and macro buttons. On the Contacts sheet we can see the formatted table which acts as the database itself. And we can see the generated vba also. 
So, lets now use the database by entering a new record and see it perform. 
And here is the PowerShell script. Examine it by accessing it from the supplied GitHub repo.  Comments have been added. You will see the VBA listed within the script. Note PowerShell returns full .NET objects. This means you are effectively writing .NET commands when writing in the PowerShell language.
This script is a conversion of a previous Visual Basic Scripts file created by Excel YouTuber Randy Austin. This demo is proof that advanced Visual Basic  scripts can be converted to PowerShell scripts. This is especially relevant given that Visual Basic scripts is being deprecated.

Microsoft is Deprecating Visual Basic Scripts
Here’s what the future holds for Visual Basic Script (VBScript) on Windows—and what you should do about it:
________________________________________
VBScript Deprecation in Windows: Timeline & Key Phases
Microsoft has officially announced a three-phase plan to deprecate VBScript:
1.	Phase 1: Starting second half of 2024
VBScript will become a Feature on Demand (FOD)—still enabled by default on Windows 11 (version 24H2) to minimize disruption as users transition away (BleepingComputer, TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, Neowin).
2.	Phase 2: Around 2027
VBScript will continue as an FOD but will no longer be enabled by default. If your systems rely on it, you'll need to manually enable it via:
Settings → System → Optional features → Add an optional feature → VBScript (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, XDA Developers, Neowin).
3.	Phase 3: Date TBD (post-2027)
VBScript will be completely removed from future Windows versions—its .dll files gone and scripts that depend on it will simply stop working (BleepingComputer, TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, Neowin).
________________________________________
Context & Reasoning Behind the Deprecation
•	Security Risks & Low Usage: VBScript has been widely exploited in malware (e.g., Emotet, LokiBot), making it a notable attack surface (BleepingComputer, XDA Developers, The Hacker News).
•	Modern Alternatives: Microsoft advocates transitioning to more capable and secure tools—namely PowerShell for automation and administrative tasks, and JavaScript for web-related functions (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, XDA Developers, The Hacker News).
•	End of Active Development: VBScript hasn’t seen updates in decades and is effectively retired—superseded by technologies like Active Scripting and PowerShell (Wikipedia).
________________________________________
What Should You Do Now?
Here’s how to prepare for the transition:
•	Identify VBScript Dependencies
Use detection strategies (e.g., scanning for .vbs usage in WSH, .asp, Office integration) to map out where VBScript is in use (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM).
•	Migrate to Modern Alternatives
o	For sysadmin and automation tasks: Rewrite in PowerShell.
o	For scripts embedded in web pages or Classic ASP: Transition to JavaScript or modern frameworks (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, Windows 11 Forum).
•	Start Testing Now
Enable/disable VBScript via FOD in test environments. Use DISM or GPOs to simulate Phase 2+ scenarios and catch failures early (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM).

Industry Reactions & Real-World Examples
On Reddit, professionals have already started sharing scenarios and advice:
“Key points: Will be made an on-by-default feature on demand (FOD) in the second half of 2024 – that FOD will be disabled by default some time in 2027 – complete removal of the VBS FOD is still TBD.” (Reddit)
“To my fellow VBA developers… Things like the Dictionary object, the FileSystemObject and other useful libraries will no longer be available and cause compile errors in your code.” (Reddit)
“For those that didn’t know, PSADT does utilise VBScript via wscript.exe to launch PowerShell silently… It’s being worked on to provide an alternative method that doesn’t rely on VBScript however!” (Reddit)
________________________________________
Summary Table
Timeframe	VBScript Status	Action Needed
Late 2024	VBScript as FOD, enabled by default	Begin assessing usage and plan migration
~2027	VBScript FOD no longer enabled by default	Prepare to enable manually if still required
Post-2027	VBScript removed from Windows entirely	Ensure all VBScript-dependent systems are migrated
________________________________________
Bottom Line
VBScript is being phased out—but you're not left stranded. You have a clear runway to adapt. Start by:
•	Auditing and cataloguing VBScript use.
•	Rewriting critical scripts with PowerShell or JavaScript.
•	Testing now to avoid damage control later.
