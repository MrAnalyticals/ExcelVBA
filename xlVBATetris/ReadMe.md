Using Copilot, ChatGPT AND Azure 4Omni Chat I was able to code Tetris. The first two LLMs failed!! The limits on their token usage stopped me! I had to provision my own Azure LLM to complete the task! Nice Sunday afternoon coding project, though.

Why not build on my code to make the shapes irregularly shaped rather than rectangular or have the game speed up as time goes on? Or have two games running side by said on the same worksheet?!

Another experiment for you -- take a screenshot of the worksheet together with the buttons and play grid and ask your favourite LLM (perhaps the new o1) to "supply the code for it".  

It's hard to believe but humanity has reached the point where we describe, in a paragraph, an app and it gets built for us. 

Every industry across the planet is being disrupted by the new LLMs even the art industry. Want your own Van Gough? No problem. Ask an LLM for your own unique version that, perhaps, includes yourself in it!! 

What's next for humanity? I would like to hear your predictions, please.
